# Home Assistant integration for espMeshMesh

## Introduction

Home Assistant integration to control the espMeshMesh network Nodes build around ESPHome over the serial.

## Features

* Connects to the espMeshMesh network via a serial Coordintor over serial or network interface
* Sending commands to specific nodes
* Reading the node status
* Uses asynchronous IO

## Protocol

espMeshMesh uses the 802.11 protocol to connect different device to allow the esphome API to report back to Home-Assistant. This
integration supports not only the API but support also an option to update node via the commoin protocol.

## Hardware

### Serial port

To allow this integration to work you need to connect an ESP32 via USB to your own Home-Assistant. running esphome with *MeshMesh:* setup as serial bridge. [firmware](https://github.com/EspMeshMesh/esphome-meshmesh/blob/main/coordinator-esp32-wroom32.yaml)

## Adding a new espMeshMesh Node

- After restarting go to **Settings** then **Devices & Services**
- Select **+ Add integration** and type in *espMeshMesh Hub*
- Select the serial port or enter the path manually
- Enter the baud rate
- Select **Submit**

A new espMeshMesh integration and device will now be added to your
Integrations view.

## Actions

The integration supports actions so commands can be send which are (not yet) implemented.

`benqprojector.send` This action allows you to send commands with or withouth action to your BenQ
Projector. To get the current state of a setting use `?` as the action.

```
action: benqprojector.send
data:
  device_id: 1481637509cb0c89ea1582e195fe6370
  command: "pow"
  action: "?"
```

`benqprojector.send_raw` This action allows you to send any raw command to your BenQ Projector. The
command needs to include the `*` and `#` prefix and suffix.

```
action: benqprojector.send_raw
data:
  device_id: 1481637509cb0c89ea1582e195fe6370
  command: "*pow=?#"
```
